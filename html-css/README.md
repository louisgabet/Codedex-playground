# HTML & CSS Projects

This folder contains all my HTML and CSS learning exercises.

## Structure
- Each project should have its own folder
- Include both HTML and CSS files
- Add screenshots or descriptions of what you built

## Example
```
html-css/
├── personal-page/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── README.md
└── landing-page/
    ├── index.html
    └── style.css
```
