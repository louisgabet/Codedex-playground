# Python Scripts

This folder contains all my Python learning exercises and scripts.

## Structure
- Organize files by topic or difficulty level
- Use descriptive names for your scripts (e.g., `calculator.py`, `guess_game.py`)
- Add comments in your code to explain what you learned

## Example
```
python/
├── beginner/
│   ├── hello_world.py
│   └── variables.py
├── intermediate/
│   └── functions.py
└── advanced/
    └── oop_basics.py
```
