Here, you can find all the scripts I’ve written for different projects as I learned various programming languages on Codédex.

# 💻 About Codédex

[**Codédex**](https://www.codedex.io/) is an **interactive learning platform** that makes coding fun and accessible.  
It offers beginner-friendly lessons, challenges, and projects in multiple programming languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **HTML/CSS**.

Through hands-on exercises and guided tutorials, I’ve learned to build real mini-projects while improving my understanding of programming logic, problem-solving, and clean code.

# 👽 About Me

I’m a French student at 👽[**Unilasalle-Amiens**](https://www.unilasalle-amiens.fr/)👽,  
studying **computer networking** and **IoT (Internet of Things)** in my fourth year.  

I want to improve my skills in different subjects like **programming**, **networking**, and my **English skills** (Yes, I know I’m French).  
Using GitHub is the **best way to succeed**.  

For now, GitHub will only focus on **programming**, but I hope that in the future, I will also explore other domains.  

At the end of my studies, I want to work in the field of **cybersecurity**, **networking**, or **Linux administration**.  
For me, cybersecurity will be one of the most important **pillars** to help **make our society safer**.  

Data is very important for companies, and many of them do not implement proper security measures in their networks.  

This year, I am looking for a **4-month internship** starting at the end of March.

## 🎵 Hobbies & Interests

I’m not just a student; I love to practice **sports** like **weight training**, **running**, and **football**.  

One of my favorite **activities** is playing music. I taught myself **piano**, **guitar**, and **drums**.  

I’m also in a **theater troupe** at my university.  

For now, I have a **jazz band** with two friends, and we plan to **perform a concert in March 2026**. 🎷

I also love **cooking**, **3D printing**, **composing and producing music**, **video editing**, and many other activities.  
I enjoy **exploring new things** and discovering new ways to be creative. 🎨
