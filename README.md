# 🚀 My Programming Portfolio - Codédex Journey

Welcome to my programming portfolio! This repository is my personal space where I document my learning journey and showcase all the code I've written while learning programming on [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/).

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

### Adding Your Work

1. **Python Scripts**: Drop your `.py` files in the `python/` folder
2. **JavaScript Code**: Add your `.js` files to the `javascript/` folder
3. **Web Projects**: Create a new folder in `html-css/` for each website you build
4. **Complete Projects**: Put finished projects in the `projects/` folder with their own README
5. **Track Progress**: Update `learning-notes/progress-log.md` to document your journey

### Organizing Your Files

- **By Topic**: Create subfolders like `python/beginner/`, `python/games/`, etc.
- **By Date**: Use folders like `python/2024-01/` if you prefer chronological organization
- **By Project**: Group related files together in their own folders

### Best Practices

✅ Use descriptive file names: `calculator.py` instead of `script1.py`
✅ Add comments in your code to explain what you learned
✅ Include a README in complex projects to document what they do
✅ Update your progress log regularly to track your growth
✅ Commit your code regularly with meaningful messages
