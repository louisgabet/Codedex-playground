# What is Codedex
[https://www.codedex.io/home](CodÃ©dex) is an interactive platform that teaches coding in a fun and engaging way.
It offers beginner-friendly lessons, challenges, and projects in different programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.

Through hands-on exercises and guided tutorials, Iâ€™ve been able to learn the fundamentals of programming while building real mini-projects.
Each step helps me strengthen my logic, problem-solving skills, and confidence as a developer.

This repository contains all the projects and exercises Iâ€™ve completed during my learning journey on CodÃ©dex. ðŸš€
